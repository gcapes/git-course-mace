### Pulling changes from a remote repository

Now when we have a remote repository, we can share it and collaborate with
others (and we can also work from multiple locations: for example from a laptop
and a desktop in the lab). But how do we get the latest changes? One way is
simply to clone the repository every time but this is inefficient, especially
if our repository is very large. So, Git allows us to get the latest changes
down from a repository. 

We'll first do a "dry run" of pulling changes from a remote repository and
then we'll work in pairs for some real-life practice.

First, let us leave our current local repository,

```
$ cd ..  
$ ls
```
{: .bash}

```
$ conversions
```
{: .output}

And let us clone our repository again, but this time specify the local
directory name,

```
$ git clone https://github.com/<USERNAME>/conversions.git laptop_conversions 
Cloning into 'laptop_conversions'...
```
{: .bash}


So we now have two clones of our repository,

```
$ ls
```
{: .bash}

```
$ conversions laptop_conversions
```
{: .output}

Let's pretend these clones are on two separate machines! So we have 3 versions
of our repository - our two local versions, on our separate machines (we're
still pretending!) and one on GitHub. So let's go into one of our clones, add an
acknowledgements section, commit the file and push these changes to GitHub:

```    
$ cd conversions 
$ gedit journal.md		# Write acknowledgements section
$ git add journal.md 
$ git commit -m "Add acknowledgements" 
$ git push
```
{: .bash}

Now let's change to our other repository and `fetch` the changes from our
remote repository,

```    
$ cd ../laptop_conversions		# Switch to the other directory
$ git fetch
```
{: .bash}

We can now see what the differences are by doing,

```    
$ git diff origin/master
```
{: .bash}

which compares our current, `master` branch, with an `origin/master` branch
which is the name of the `master` branch in `origin` which is the alias for our
cloned repository, the one on GitHub.

We can then `merge` these changes into our current repository, which merges the
branches together,

```    
$ git merge origin/master
```
{: .bash}

And then we can check that we have our changes,

```    
$ cat journal.md 
$ git log
```
{: .bash}

As a short-hand, we can do a `git pull` which does a `git fetch` then a `git merge`. 
Now try the same process, but this time starting in the laptop_conversions folder (you
should already be in the laptop_conversions folder), and write an abstract:

```    
$ gedit journal.md		# Write abstract
$ git add journal.md 
$ git commit -m "Write abstract" journal.md 
$ git push origin master
$ cd ../conversions			# Switch back to the conversions directory
$ git pull origin master	# Get changes from remote repository
```
{: .bash}

And then check that we have our changes,

```    
$ cat journal.md 
$ git log
```
{: .bash}

> ## `Fetch` vs `pull`
> If `git pull` is a shortcut for `git fetch` followed by `git merge` then, why would
> you ever want to do these steps separately?
>
> Well, depending on what the commits on the remote branch contain,
> you might want to abandon your local commits before merging
> (e.g. your local commits duplicate the changes on the remote),
> rebase your local branch to avoid a merge commit, or something else.
>
> Fetching first lets you inspect the changes
> before deciding what you want to do with them.
{: .callout}

### Conflicts and how to resolve them

Let's continue to pretend that our two local, cloned, repositories are hosted
on two different machines. You should still be in the original *conversions* folder.
Add an affilication for each author.
Then push these changes to our remote repository:

```    
$ gedit journal.md		# Add author affiliations 
$ git add journal.md 
$ git commit -m "Add author affiliations"
$ git push origin master
```
{: .bash}

Now let us suppose, at a later, date, we use our other repository and we want
to change the order of the authors.

```    
$ cd ../laptop_conversions		# Switch directory to other copy of our repository 
$ gedit journal.md		# Change order of the authors
$ git add journal.md 
$ git commit -m "Change the first author" journal.md 
$ git push origin master
```
{: .bash}
```
To https://github.com/<USERNAME>/conversions.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/<USERNAME>/conversions.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```
{: .output}

Our push fails, as we've not yet pulled down our changes from our remote
repository. Before pushing we should always pull, so let's do that...

```    
$ git pull origin master
```
{: .bash}

and we get:

```    
Auto-merging journal.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in journal.md
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```
{: .output}

As we saw earlier, with the fetch and merge, a `git pull` pulls down changes from the
repository and tries to merge them. It does this on a file-by-file basis,
merging files line by line. We get a **conflict** if a file has changes that
affect the same lines and those changes can't be seamlessly merged. We had this
situation before when we worked with branches and tried to merge two of them. If
we look at the status,

```
$ git status
```
{: .bash}

we can see that our file is listed as *Unmerged* and if we look at
*journal.md*, we may see something like:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
Author
G Capes, J Smith
=======
author
J Smith, G Capes
>>>>>>> 1b55fe7f23a6411f99bf573bfb287937ecb647fc
```

The mark-up shows us the parts of the file causing the conflict and the
versions they come from. We now need to manually edit the file to *resolve* the
conflict. Just like we did when we had to deal with the conflict when we were
merging the branches.

We edit the file. Then commit our changes. Now, if we *push* ...

```
$ gedit journal.md		# Edit file to resolve merge conflict
$ git add journal.md		# Stage the file
$ git commit			# Commit to mark the conflict as resolved
$ git push origin master
```
{: .bash}
{: .bash}

... all goes well. If we now go to GitHub and click on the "Overview" tab we can
see where our repository diverged and came together again.

This is where version control proves itself better than DropBox or GoogleDrive,
this ability to merge text files line-by-line and highlight the conflicts
between them, so no work is ever lost.
